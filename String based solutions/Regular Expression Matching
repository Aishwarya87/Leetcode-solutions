.  = for any character but has to be a character 
* = for 0(nothing) or more occurences of the preceding character
s * = nothing, s, ss, sss, ........
. *= nothing, . ., . . ., . . ., . . . . (the character can be mixed as well like s s i)
Will make a DP grid for this problem between pattern and string
if last character of string== last character of the pattern, diagnolly above
if last character of string!= last character of the pattern, put FALSE
if pattern has dot, then diagnolly above

INN THE TABLE
for column_number=0; for character and . in pattern, put false, bc they need atleast one character to satisfy(plus diagnolly above) but dont have any.
for column_number=0; if encounter *, 2 rows above.
is s==p, then check diagnolly, else: false
if diagnolly its false, then false. 
m i s * == m i ,  m i s, m i s s,  ........., m i s s *
in a nutshell, m i s *== EITHER mi or miss*,     2 rows above, left(if the last character before * in pattern is equal to the last character in string) 
.  == matches with every character, have to check diagnolly
